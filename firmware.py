    @section sec_o      Overview 
                        This card dealer machine project is centered around an Arduino Nano, selected for its compact size and efficient logic control, 
                        paired with two NEMA 17 stepper motorsâ€”one for the machine's rotation and another for card dealing precision. 
                        The user interface combines a small OLED screen for crisp information display, including player count and game settings, and a 12x4 keyboard for easy data entry, all within a design that's both space-efficient and durable for continuous use. 
                        Detailed interconnectivity and operation of these electronic components will be further elaborated in the firmware documentation section.

    @section sec_1s     Schematic Diagram
                        Overall, the schematic below describe the connections between pins and electronics component of the robot.
                        Keynote:
                            1. Power voltage 12V for Stepper Motor (2 pins)
                            2. Power voltage 9V for Arduino Nano (2 pins)
                            3. Stepper Driver Motor (16 pins/each)
                            4. OLED Screen (4 pins)
                            5. Keyboard 4x4 (8 pins)

    @section sec_2      Arduino Nano
                        The project will utilize the Arduino Nano as its microcontroller. 
                        The key benefit of selecting the Arduino Nano lies in its compact size, coupled with a sufficient number of pins to effectively manage all the necessary components.

    @section sec_3      Step Down Regulator
                        The design is configured to operate two stepper motors using a 12V input voltage. 
                        However, since the Arduino Nano microcontroller functions at 9V, directly applying 12V would damage it. 
                        Therefore, the inclusion of a step-down regulator is essential to convert the voltage from 12V to 9V, thereby safely powering the Arduino Nano microcontroller.

    @section sec_32     DRV8825 Stepper Motor Driver 
                        For saving pins from the controller and simplified the control of 2 stepper motor (usually need 4 pwm pins). 
                        Consider DRV8825 driver can save up to 2 pins for every operating stepper motor
