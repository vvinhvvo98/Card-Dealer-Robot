OBJECTIVE</h1>
<p>The project's purpose is to design a robot that simplifies the card-dealing process for popular games such as Poker and Blackjack. The robot will be equipped with a straightforward display screen, allowing players to easily select the game, determine the number of participants, and set the card distribution per player. It will include a convenient memory feature to enable users to quickly replay the game without re-entering the same details, maintaining the card order for consistency in games where this is essential. Speed in dealing cards is a critical aspect, ensuring that game flow is not interrupted. In addition, the robot will be crafted with an aesthetically pleasing design, making it an attractive addition to any gaming table. This blend of functionality, speed, and design aims to deliver a seamless and engaging card game experience.</p>
<pre class="fragment">@section sec_2       HARDWARE
                     The design concept for this project involves constructing a robot with a two-part subassembly. 
                     The first part is the base, designed to remain immobile, providing stability and support. 
                     The second part is an upper segment that incorporates a spur gear. 
                     This gear will be connected to a stepper motor, which is responsible for the controlled rotational and pivotal movements of the robot, allowing it to adjust its orientation as needed.

                     To visualize the idea before we proceed with the detailed engineering work, a hand-drawn sketch will be used. This sketch will serve as a preliminary visual guide, illustrating the basic structure and function of the two-part mechanism.

                     SKETCH GOES HERE

                     For more information on the design, you can check out the detailed CAD model at @ref hardware.

@section sec_3       FIRMWARE
                     For the educational objectives of the Mechatronics ME 405 course, the selected microcontroller is the Nucleo STM32, which is complemented by an extension board known as the "Shoe of Brian." 
                     This extension board, provided by Lecturer Charlie Refvem, enables the use of the MicroPython programming language with the Nucleo STM32, offering an alternative to the conventional C language. 
                     The Nucleo STM32 is readily available for purchase on platforms like Amazon at an affordable price, making it accessible for students. 
                     However, the "Shoe of Brian" extension board is specially designed and developed exclusively for the ME 405 course by of Dr. Ridgely.
                     Figure below is the Nucleo STM32 microcontroller, integrated with its specialized extension, the "Shoe of Brian" board. 

                     @image html Nucleo.png

                     More details about how the electronic parts are connected and designed will be given in the @ref firmware section. 
                     This part of the document will clearly explain how all the components work together.

@section sec_4      SIMULATION
                    The simulation aspect of this project involves creating a model and manually deriving the equations of motion for ROMI. 
                    Two solvers, the Euler solver and the RK4 solver, are used to predict and control ROMI's path based on the velocities of both wheels. 
                    The simulation considers two approaches: the first involves selecting the turning radius and speed of ROMI, while the second focuses on determining the wheel speeds as a function of time.

                    These simulations are then integrated into either Jupyter Notebook or MATLAB with detailed results presented in the @ref simulation section. 
                    However, understanding the underlying physics and geometry of these equations can be challenging. 
                    A figure is provided below, which illustrates the hand-derived model of ROMI in a state-space vector format, complete with explanations of all parameters and their dimensions.

@section sec_5      FINAL DESIGN
                    The final CAD design of the ROMI robot includes an array of components: a digital line sensor module with five channels, an analog line sensor module, an ultrasonic distance sensor, two DC motors each equipped with built-in encoders, and two micro servos. 
                    The complete assembly of ROMI, representing the culmination of the term project, is depicted in the figure below. 
                    This design is current as of December 13, 2023. Please note that any further updates beyond this date will not be included in this portfolio due to time constraints.

@section sec_6      TASK DIAGRAM
                    The robot will concurrently execute four tasks, as outlined in the Task Diagram below. 
                    This diagram specifies the duration (in ms) and relative priority of each task. 
                    These tasks will be scheduled according to their assigned priorities and periods using a scheduler script, the code for which has been provided by Lecturer Charlie Refvem.

                    Note: All diagrams are listed and explain in detail at @ref diagram for futher more description

                    @image html tasks_diagram.png

@section sec_7      MILESTONES DEMO
                    Below are four consecutive milestones that are overcome to complete the project as describe in the objective section. ROMI should first be able to follow any type of black line that is drawn, avoid a random wall obstacle at any point, stop at the predetermined target, the finally return at the Home position
                    Furthermore about the logic behind the performance, please visit the Task Diagram as well as the Finite State Machine Diagram at @ref diagram, also state diagram can approach at the task section below:

                    task_MOT.py - Control ROMI motor base on input share from different task  

                    task_IMU.py - Rrun BNO055 IMU Sensor and processing the data

                    task_ULS.py - Managing Ultrasonic Sensor readings in a state machine manner

                    task_SER.py - Control servo motors based on external signals and states



                    Line Following Demo

                    This demonstration focus the consistency of the line-following function and the ROMI's capability to recognize the absence of a line signal. 
                    When no line is detected, the ROMI will slow down in explore mode. 
                    This function marks the first milestone of the whole project

                    @image html LINEDEMO.gif

                    Wall Obstacle Avoiding Demo

                    This demonstration focus on the capability of avoiding wall obstacles.
                    As illustrated in the small GIF figure below, ROMI is able to adapt to obstacles at any size and will return back the track as soon as the ultrasonic distance sensor can not detect the wall anymore.
                    This design will make sure ROMI can getaway from any obstacle size and loction not just the praticing obstacle in the lab.
                    This function marks the second milestone of the whole project

                    @image html WALLDEMO.gif

                    Stop at Target Demo

                    This demonstration focus on the ability of stop at the Target after avoiding the obstacle. When no line is detected, the ROMI will slow down in explore mode and keep track of the traveled distance since its translate in to explore mode.
                    If the distance is greater than 0.15 [m] or 15 [cm], ROMI will stop and notice that as the Target.
                    This function marks the third milestone of the whole project

                    @image html GOALDEMO.gif

                    Return Home Demo

                    This demonstration focus on the ability of returning Home after reaching the Target. By collecting the IMU yaw corrected yaw angle and the distance travel of very cycle of task, ROMI is able to keep track of X and Y global cordinate which is exactly the same
                    cordinate from the hand derivation of the previous sectio that can be found at @ref simulation. Then the returning goal can be breakdown to 2 distingush state, return y until y ~ 0 [m] and then return x until x ~ 0 [m]. 
                    This function marks the final milestone of the whole project

                    @image html RETURNDEMO.gif

@section sec_8      FULLCOURSE DEMONSTRATION
                    As detailed in @ref sec_1 Section, the integration of all milestones archived in  @ref sec_7 is more than sufficient to enable the autonomous two-wheeled robot ROMi to successfully complete the practice course outlined

                    The final run result in ROMI is able to complete the whole course and return to the starting location in [33 seconds] total.

                    The final course setup is described in figure below for competitors.
