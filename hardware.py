    @section sec_1      Overview
                        This robot has a strong design with two linear ball bearings and a 3/4 inches shaft to support its structure. 
                        On top of this base, it has electronic parts and spacers for organization. 
                        Its card distribution system uses a spring to press cards against a spinning wheel, driven by a NEMA 17 motor. 
                        The part that distributes cards can be easily removed and attached with four magnets for quick card loading
