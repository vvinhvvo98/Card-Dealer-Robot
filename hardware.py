    @section sec_bro    Overview
                        For the robot to function efficiently, a few key hardware components are necessary. 
                        This includes a mounting bracket to secure the Nucleo STM32 microcontroller, 
                        a counterweight bracket to keep the robot balanced, 
                        brackets for attaching servos which aid in movement, 
                        and an ultrasonic sensor bracket for distance measurement and obstacle detection. 
                        Additionally, a protective blindfold for the sensor is necessary when it's not in use, 
                        and a ROMI's stand is also designed for calibration purpose
